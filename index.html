            <h1>Shah Rukh Khan</h1>
            <p>From an unknown guy to one of the most popular superstars, from a simple middle-class man to one of the richest actors of India.. the man has achieved it all! Yes.. I am talking about the charming, elegant and extremely stylish gentleman, Shah Rukh Khan, the actor, the mega star!

                Hailing from a simple Indian family, SRK faced the biggest tragedy of his life at a very young age. He lost his father at the age of 15 and then his mother when he was 26.. it’s hard to imagine how he coped with losing two of the most important people in his life.But then he was Shahrukh Khan! With dreams in his eyes and a strong will power in his heart, he overcame every challenge that was thrown at him.. in the most spectacular fashion!

                There can’t be a bigger irony than the fact that the man whose first income was only Rs 50 can now produce a 150 crore movie! From 1992 to 2012, it has been a long journey for the “King of bollywood” as he is lovingly called by his fans. It all started with his act in a TV serial ‘Fauji’, but SRK made his Bollywood debut in Deewana (1992) and since then has gone on to act in more than 70 films!

                He has played it all.. an obessive lover in Darr and Anjaam, a ruthless serial killer in Baazigar, the charming lover boy in DDLJ, Dil To Pagal Hai, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, extremely intense and romantic characters in Veer-Zaara and Kal Ho Naa Ho, a music teacher in Mohabbatein, scientist in Swades, major in Main Hoon Naa, a coach in Chak De India, villian in Don/Don2, an innocent autistic character in My Name Is Khan and a superhero in Ra.One!

                Most of his movies have been hugely successful commercially, while earning him critical acclaim too! While his romantic acts got him the tag of “King of Romance”, SRK has been highly praised by critics and audience for his performances in films like Chak De India and Swades! Now, he is considered as one of the most successful actors in cinematic history. With no Godfather who can back him, the man has achieved it all on his own with his hard work, dedication, passion and self-confidence! He is a role model for many and is a true source of inspiration for aspiring actors!
